We have created a main.scss and linked it to the main.css files in the dist folder.
Future css code will be writte on the scss file and automatically saves itself in the main.css file.
for this we have installed the npm module by;

initialize it by "npm init"

enter the questions and answers

a package.json will be installed. open it and navigate the script command line.
Under it type this command;
"sass": "node-sass -w scss -o dist/css --recursive"

in the terminal click "npm i node-sass"

this will download the npm module via the terminal.


this helps all the scss that we will write to go be wriiten in a main.css folder

use "npm run sass" to run the sass

create a .gitignore and add node-modules there so as not to commit the node modules folder to git

to deploy the page add homepage in the package.json eg. "homepage": "https://leenduati.github.io/makeshiftPortfolio",

and then deploy under the scripts eg. 
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
